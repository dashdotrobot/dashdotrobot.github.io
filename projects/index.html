<h2 id="hands-on-labs-to-support-student-agency">Hands-on labs to support student agency</h2>
<p>Under the new ABET criteria, students are expected to demonstrate "an ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions" (ABET 2019).
Traditional, recipe-based labs provide few opportunities for students to engage in realistic experimental design, and recent research has cast doubt on their pedagogical benefit (Holmes, et. al. 2018).
At the same time, disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic has forced institutions to move to virtual and geographically distributed learning.</p>
<p>I have developed virtual and hands-on collaborative "lab" activities for engineering students. No longer constrained by the narrow range of experiments that can be "properly" performed on an MTS, students faced and overcame more authentic engineering challenges by designing precise experiments with household materials.</p>
<ul>
<li>Watch my <a href="https://www.handsonmechanics.org/mechanics-of-materials/830">presentation at ASEE 2020</a> about adapting hands-on labs for remote instruction</li>
<li>Watch some <a href="https://www.handsonmechanics.org/mechanics-of-materials/839">videos created by my students</a> demonstrating common ASTM tests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hear it from my students:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"The collaborative labs were my favorite part. I can say with certainty that this has been one of the most informative courses I've taken so far at Cornell."</em></p>
<p><em>"He was continuously coming up with creative ways to exhibit concepts of the course that each student could replicate in their own homes."</em></p>

<h2 id="motivation-and-self-efficacy">Motivation and self-efficacy</h2>
<p>Motivation is a multi-faceted construct encompassing orientation towards certain types of goals, the value and expectation of achieving those goals, and attributional beliefs.</p>
<p>Much of the literature on motivation in engineering has focused on persistence beyond introductory courses, career choice, and differences between engineering majors.
However, our interviews with mechanical engineering students have revealed that students may form motivational beliefs and identities related to a specific subfield within their major (e.g. "I see myself as a mechatronics person, but
not a fluids person") and therefore we expect to find differences in responses between course contexts for the same student.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our study tracks cohorts of students through the junior year, across time and course context.</li>
<li>Our data set tracks students through the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing us to explore the effects of major disruption to academic life.</li>

<p>Optical microscopy is limited by the wavelength of light.
But today's nano devices have features under 10 nanometers, orders of magnitude smaller than the wavelength of visible light!
Scanning probe microscopy breaks this limit by using specially fabricated nanoprobes which use mechanical forces to map out feature topography or other properties.
Near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) combines an optical probe with a mechanical probe by using a sharp metal tip as an "optical antenna," which focuses a far-field laser source to a sub-wavelength hotspot.</p>
<p>We use this optical hotspot as a dynamic probe to measure mechanical vibrations.
We are able to measure vibrations less than one picometer with a spatial resolution of just a few nanometers.
This sensitive tool can be used to probe graphene devices, carbon nanotube resonators, or complex MEMS devices.</p>
